### SBPMixer_Driver (SBPMIXER.PAS)

**_SBPMIXER.PAS_** Custom driver for the _Creative Labs SoundBlaster Pro_ mixer chipset.
The original source for creating the OBJ and DRV files is now lost. However, you can easily
recreate them by just wrapping the the SBPMixerDriver function up using the COMASM program
template to recreate them. (A few more steps, but that will get you underway.)
