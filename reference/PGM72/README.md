### Program Manager v7.2 (PGM72.PAS)

**_PGM72.PAS_** Unfortunately, PGM is missing the correct versions of units and is 
broken. Currently it compiles, runs and functions mostly correct. I may fix it someday. 
I may not. Originally, It used Borland's CRT unit and an early predecessor to QCrt, the
Screens & ScrnUtil units. 

What's broken: 
	Video is not in color, and sometimes doesn't draw correctly.
	Mouse, not visible and doesnt work.
	Installer is broken.
