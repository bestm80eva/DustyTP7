Everything thing in here is either broken, relies on third party units or was strictly an experiment. I may fix the broken stuff since their problems mostly stem from not having the correct versions of their units and other files. However, don't get your hopes up. I only have so much time to devote to ancient code.

I am providing them mainly as a reference and parts of their code could be informative or useful.
