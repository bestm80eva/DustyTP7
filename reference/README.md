### Reference 

Here rests miscellaneousness bits and pieces of projects. Nearly all the source in here will not 
compile as they are now. They are either strictly experiments, broken, were _"a work in progress"_, 
missing units or contain references to units by third parties that I don't have the right to redistribute.
Some, may be fixable. Most probably aren't. The only reason they are being provided is
a reference material and may contain useful snippets of code.
