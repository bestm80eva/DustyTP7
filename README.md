Recently, I have decided to release many of my ancient **_Turbo Pascal 7.0_** source files to 
the general public as open source under the **_Mozilla Public license_**. These source files
were written over 20 years ago and for the most part, have not been updated since. I do 
intend on making some minor modifications to several of the programs that have issues 
running on modern hardware. Mainly, this will be to swap out references to the _Borland
CRT_ unit for My _QCRT_ unit. The _Borland_ version crashes on modern computers with their 
very fast clock speeds. 

These files may serve no real purpose in todays modern computing environments. However,
you may find them useful as examples or even starting points for other projects. They 
are being provided **AS-IS** and I make no claim to there stability or usefulness for any
purpose.

Generally, only the final version of each program, unit, include file, etc. will be 
provided. The main exception is, when a specific program requires a specific
older version of the source to be able to compile, it will be included. I will also
try and provide a brief description of what each of them does.

Anyway, this is a work in progress. Most of my old source files are jumbled about in nested directories and
didn't include version numbers. Multiple copies of the same code. Backup copies. Missing units in projects. Over 20 years, migrating from one computer to another, I'm ammazed I still have nearly all of it. But, its a rats nest of 
source code. So, as I find time to weed through it, I plan to keep adding stuff. 

Some of the stuff to come includes: Text mode smooth scrolling directory lister. Pre-Windows application launcher, Couple Games... and more Utilities.

Compiled versions of each program are located under the bin directory.
