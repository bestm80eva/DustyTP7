Recently, I have decided to release many of my ancient **_Turbo Pascal 7.0_** source files to 
the general public as open source under the **_Mozilla Public license_**. These source files
were written over 20 years ago and for the most part, have not been updated since. I do 
intend on making some minor modifications to several of the programs that have issues 
running on modern hardware. Mainly, this will be to swap out references to the Borland
CRT unit for My QCRT unit. The Borland version crashes on computers with to high a clock
speed. 

These files may serve no real purpose in todays modern computing environments. However,
you may find them useful as examples or even starting points for other projects. They 
are being provided **AS-IS** and I make no claim to there stability or usefulness for any
purpose.

Generally, only the final version of each program, unit, include file, etc. will be 
provided. The main exception to that is when a specific program requires a specific
older version of the source to be able to compile. I will also try and provide a brief 
description of what each of them does.

Compiled versions of each program are located under the bin directory.
